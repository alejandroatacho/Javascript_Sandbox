// Sure, here's a simple project idea that you can try to implement in JavaScript:

// Create a program that calculates the factorial of a given number.

// To calculate the factorial of a number, you multiply that number by every positive integer less than it. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

// You can use a for loop to iterate through the positive integers less than the given number and keep a running total of the product. Then, you can print the result to the console.

// This project should take less than 10 minutes to complete and will give you a good introduction to loops and basic math operations in JavaScript.

const readline = require('readline');
const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout
});



// rl.question('Write a number down: ', (answer) => {
//   console.log(`The number you wrote is: ${answer}`);
//   rl.close();
// });
